.. _how_to_setup_readme_gridgen:

Creating a README file
-----------------------

Creates a text file that explains the abstract of the grid generating
program.

Creates a text file with name \"README\" in the folder you created in
:ref:`create_gridgen_folder`.
Save the file with UTF-8 encoding.

You should create the README file with the file names like below. When
the language-specific README file does not exists, \"README\" file (in
English) will be used.

- English: \"README\"
- Japanese: \"README\_ja\_JP\"

The postfix (ex. \"ja\_JP\") is the same to that for dictionary files
created in :ref:`how_to_setup_dictionary_gridgen`.

The content of \"README\" will be shown in \"Description\" area on the
[Select Grid Creating Algorithm] dialog. When you created \"README\",
opens the [Select Grid Creating Algorithm] dialog, and check whether the
content is shown on that dialog.

:numref:`screenshot_for_readme_gridgen`
shows an example of the [Select Grid Creating Algorithm]
dialog.
