.. _how_to_setup_license:

Creating a LICENSE file
------------------------

Creates a text file that explains the license information of the solver.

Creates a text file with name \"LICENSE\" in the folder you created in
:ref:`create_solverdef_folder`. Save the file with UTF-8 encoding.

You should create the LICENSE file with the file names like below. When
the language-specific LICENSE file does not exists, \"LICENSE\" file (in
English) will be used.

-  English: \"LICENSE\"
-  Japanese: \"LICENSE\_ja\_JP\"

The postfix (ex. \"ja\_JP\") is the same to that for dictionary files
created in :ref:`how_to_setup_dictionary`.

The content of \"LICENSE\" will be shown in \"License\" area on the [Select
Solver] dialog. When you created \"LICENSE\", opens the [Select Solver]
dialog by starting a new project, and check whether the content is shown
on that dialog.

:numref:`screenshot_for_license` shows an example of
the [Select Solver] dialog.
