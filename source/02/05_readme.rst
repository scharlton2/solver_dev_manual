.. _how_to_setup_readme:

Creating a README file
-----------------------

Creates a text file that explains the abstract of the solver.

Creates a text file with name \"README\" in the folder you created in
:ref:`create_solverdef_folder`. Save the file with UTF-8 encoding.

You should create the README file with the file names like below. When
the language-specific README file does not exists, \"README\" file (in
English) will be used.

-  English: \"README\"
-  Japanese: \"README\_ja\_JP\"

The postfix (ex. \"ja\_JP\") is the same to that for dictionary files
created in :ref:`how_to_setup_dictionary`.

The content of \"README\" will be shown in \"Description\" area on the
[Select Solver] dialog. When you created \"README\",
opens the [Select Solver] dialog by starting a new project,
and check whether the content is shown on that dialog.
